    <h2>500-Word Reflection Essay</h2>

    <p>Throughout this semester, the Graphic and Web Design Studio (GWDS) module has provided me with a strong foundation in both design theory and practical web development. Coming from a business background, this creative direction has been refreshing and personally rewarding. The module structure—covering CRAP design principles, typography, and web development—enabled me to build a well-rounded understanding of how effective visual communication is crafted and delivered.</p>

    <p>At the beginning of the module, I had very limited knowledge of HTML and CSS. I was initially nervous about coding from scratch, but through weekly workshops and guided worksheets, I steadily grew more confident. One of the biggest turning points was the HTML/CSS worksheet project, where I learned how structure, layout, and styling work together. By using GitHub to manage version control and host my website, I also gained essential technical skills that I know will be valuable in future professional projects.</p>

    <p>Equally important was the emphasis on graphic design principles. The CRAP project helped me understand how contrast, alignment, repetition, and proximity guide the viewer's attention and create balance in a design. These principles became even more clear when applied to the typography project, where I experimented with hierarchy and type pairings. I learned how small details—like line height, font weight, and spacing—can impact readability and aesthetic harmony.</p>

    <p>Building the final design project allowed me to bring together everything I had learned. It was incredibly fulfilling to see my mockups turn into a fully functional website that showcases my creativity and technical growth. I carefully considered layout, image quality, and user experience while ensuring the site worked across different screen sizes. This final project also pushed me to reflect on my own design voice and how I communicate visually.</p>

    <p>As a non-native English speaker and someone adjusting to life in the UK, this module also helped me express myself more confidently through visual storytelling. I felt supported by my tutors and classmates, and I appreciated the inclusive environment that encouraged experimentation and feedback. The skills I have gained in this module—technical coding, creative design, and reflective thinking—will serve me well in both my academic journey and professional development.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, the GWDS module has exceeded my expectations. It transformed my understanding of design from something abstract into a practical and powerful form of communication. I now feel more equipped to pursue future projects, build a creative portfolio, and continue developing as a digital media practitioner. I am proud of what I have achieved and motivated to explore even more in the field of graphic and web design.</p>
